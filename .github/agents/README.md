# Agents

Custom agent mode definitions. Each `.agent.md` file creates a specialized AI persona with constrained capabilities and specific behavioral rules.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`code-reviewer.agent.md`](code-reviewer.agent.md) | Structured, opinionated code review across any language. Covers correctness, security (OWASP), tests, maintainability, and design. |
